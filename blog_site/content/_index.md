**Hi, I'm Eunice**! I am a Filipino undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Engineering at Sogang University, South Korea. I aspire to become a multidisciplinary developer and/or designer adept in <u>Full Stack Web Development</u>, <u>Software & AI</u>, as well as <u>UI/UX & Motion Graphics Design</u>. This is a personal blog I created for life, learning, and programming documentation.
Feel free to explore!
